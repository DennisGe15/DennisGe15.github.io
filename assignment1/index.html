      <h2>Question 1</h2>  
      <h3>The first thing that drew me to the Min's Portfolio website 
        was the hand-drawn doodles and clean web design, the layout of 
        the website also attracted me to read down and swipe through the pages. 
        Therefore it is a pretty user-friendly interface.

      <h2>Question 2</h2>  
      <h3>0s: When I clicked through to minjeaseo.com, I first slid my mouse wheel to briefly browse the home page and all of the content at the bottom of the home page, and then returned to the home page to get a sense of the clean design of the web page and the featured sections of the page. This took about 25 seconds.</h3>

      <h3>25s: Then I see the project button in the top right corner of the homepage and go to the corresponding new page. This took about 10 seconds.</h3>

      <h3>45s: page then jumps to a new page with the corresponding image, and I repeat the previous actions to continue scrolling through the content of the page and try to find interesting content. At the end, I clicked on the little house button at the top left of the page to leave the page and go back to the home page. This took about 20 seconds.</h3>
        
      <h3>1:05s: After returning to the homepage, I moved my eyes to the 'See My Resume' button in the center of the homepage and clicked on it to jump to a new page. This took about 10 seconds.</h3>
        
      <h3>1:15s: The page jumped to a pdf file in Google Drive, which showed the author's resume. After briefly browsing and understanding the content, I went back to the homepage of the website. This took about 30 seconds.</h3>

      <h2>Question 3</h2>  
      <h3>The part of this experience that I spent the most time on was browsing through the resumes of the webpage authors. since I've been looking for a job lately as well, I always scrutinize the content when I see something that is related to my job search. So this was one of the most appealing parts of the whole site for me.
      </h3>

    <div id="question_box">
      <h2>Question 4</h2>  
      <h3>During my two-minute interaction with the experience, the most common action was scrolling and clicking on images and buttons. This is because in the limited time I have, I want to be able to discover as much as I can about the useful information that this site can bring me and the content that interests me.</h3>

As an illustration fan, I like his illustration on the homepage. The minimalist design and high percentage of images in the web page suggest an emphasis on allowing visitors to easily explore the designer's projects.

      <h2>Question 7</h2>  
      <h3>My experience on 'minjeaseo.com' is one of constant clicking on buttons in the page over time to go to a new page and clicking on the little house button in the top left corner to go back to the home page. This long term interaction is designed to repeat and evolve each time the interaction is repeated and developed over time. My impression of the site is that the interaction design of the pages lends itself to both short, focused visits and long, repeated engagement.</h3>

    <div id="question_box">
      <h2>Question 8</h2>  
      <h3>After interacting with Min's website, I found that the overall clean design and intuitive navigation of the site make it easy for users to understand how to interact as soon as they enter the site. The site's interactions also have some visual feedback, as when the user hovers over a clickable button, the button will indicate that it can be interacted with through a color change or a slight animation. However, some areas of the site should be optimized, for example, the only interaction modes on the site are the basic mouse click and scroll wheel. This design can make users feel bored and drained during repeated visits. If one or two new interaction modes could be added to the site, it would entice users to stay longer and use the site again and again.</h3>

    <div id="question_box">
      <h2>Question 9</h2>  
      <h3>The experience referenced the illustrations and the inclusion of illustrations on the home page and at the bottom of the pages as decoration on the website are artistic elements that add to the creativity and visual appeal of the website. These artistic elements add to the creativity and visual appeal of the site. This provides a richer sensory experience for the user. At the same time, the experience also refers to a large number of high-quality images and logos, through the reference and integration of these different forms of media, so that the experience provides users with a comprehensive experience of the integration of various visual and interactive art.

Meanwhile, the use of illustrations and images in the website shows that rich forms of expression can enhance the delivery of information. This also conveys to me that during the research process, I should consider how the presentation of the results can be enhanced and made more appealing through a variety of ways such as illustrations and images.</h3>
